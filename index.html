<br>
    <p>My name is Rafaella Nicoletti, I grew up in Chile and moved to New York City in 2015. 
        All my life  dreamed about living in the US and the wish to study fashion was what it made me come to NYC.
        Since coming here I've discovered a completely new world. One time someone asked me what word would I use to describe NYC considering my favorite authors is Oscar Wilde; and 
        the word I chose was and still is <strong>"Fantasy"</strong>, it could be good and bad, but it definitely describes what I've experimented and lived here. 
        <p>This brings me to how comfortable I am of getting out of 
        my comfort zone, I love going to parties by myself, I love travelling on my own and overall I love doing stuff alone, not because I am a "loner" per se but there's this rewarding feeling of being 
        so independent that you can have a good time anywhere. 
        I love photography, blogs, magazines, fashion, I am obsessed with reading! I absolutely love everything creative and my guilty pleasure is economics. </p>
